# Instant Media Player Service (IMPS)
This program is still in early development phase but it's general purpose is to play the sound instantly. Not like instant-instant but with very little latency. Most od the media players (especially Windows Media Player) take a while 
to actually play the sound which is not suitable for situations where you need the sound to be played at this current moment with as little latency as possible. 
**I will be expanding this README file further in the future**
